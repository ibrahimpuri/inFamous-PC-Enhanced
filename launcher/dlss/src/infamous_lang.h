/* ============================================================================================================
 * The game language behind the launcher's Language setting (included once from stubs.cpp; inert unless PS3_LANG
 * names a language the game would not pick by itself).
 *
 * RE (EU EBOOT, BCES00220): at boot the game (func_00089F80) works out which release it is by matching the title id
 * cellDiscGameGetBootDiscInfo reports against the 7 it knows: BCUS98119 (US), BCES00220, BCES00591, BCES00609,
 * BCAS20074, BCET00010 and BCET00220. Each release has the list of languages it ships, at 0x00720868: 7 x
 * { u32 count, u32 list }, in the game's own numbers (1 English, 2 French, 3 Spanish, 4 German, 5 Italian, 6 Dutch,
 * 7 Portuguese, 8 Russian, 9 Korean, 11 Chinese, 16 Polish, 17 English (UK)). The PS3 system language picks from that
 * list, and one that isn't in it gets the list's first language (func_00089818).
 *
 * The port reports the title id BLES00000, which is none of them, so the game takes the first release, the US one:
 * English, French and Spanish only. Every other system language came out in English, although the disc has every
 * European language (dialog/archive/<language>.psarc, movies/subtitles/<language>). Reporting a real release id
 * would move the save folder (the game names it after that id), so instead, when the game reads the system language,
 * the US release's list is pointed at the entry of another release's list that holds the chosen language: a list of
 * one, which the game then takes. English, French and Spanish need nothing.
